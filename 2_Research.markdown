## Research Road Map
* **Reservoir characteristics**
    * Ranking method for geological models
    * Integration of Production data and reservoir parameters 
    * Productivity vs. Reservoir parameters
* **Modelling and Simulation** 
    * Modelling with a limited well information
    * Define well configuration, injection pattern to improve injectivity for CCS
    * Multi-layer reservoirs, reservoir types(depleted or fresh one)
* **Recovery Process Optimization**
    * New process for Oilsands: modify THAI, follow up process
    * CO2 mitigation technology for Oil and Gas  

## CCUS Research Topics
* **CCS Research**
    * CO2 storage capacity:  Volumetric vs. simulation  
    * CCS cost analysis: source to sink 
    * CO2 EOR as a storage: light oil reservoir
    * CO2 EGR as a storage: shale gas and CBM   
    * Carbon Life Cycle Analysis 
* **Integration of Hydrogen and CCS**
    * CO2 balance for oil/gas field with Hydrogen production      	    * Net-Zero, Net-Negative? 
    * Blue hydrogen (H+CCS) using LNG (CH4) in Korea
    * Blue hydrogen using Natural gas field in overseas   

## Oil Sands Research Topics
